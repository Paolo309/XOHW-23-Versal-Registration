# XOHW-23-Versal-Registration

## Info & Description
Accelerator for one step of a 3D Image Registration algorithm exploiting the etherogeneity of AMD-Xilinx Versal VCK5000. The acceleration comprises the transformation of the floating volume using AI Engines and the computation of the mutual information accelerated on FPGA.

## Instructions to build and test project

### Step 0 - Using the provided XCLBIN
In the root folder of the repository submitted for the competition, the folder `build/16PE` contains the XCLBIN, the dataset and the compiled host application. To test the architecture withou the need to build the XCLBIN, you can immediately **jump to Step 5**.

### Step 1 - Clone the repository
Open a terminal, then clone the repository by running the following command
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Paolo309/XOHW-23-Versal-Registration.git
```
Then, move into the repository with 
```shell
cd XOHW-23-Versal-Registration
```

### Step 2 - Setup the environment
Before building and/or running the framework, run the following script. Notice that this will source Vitis 2022.1, xrt and devtoolset-7
```shell
source ./setup_all.sh
```
Alternatively, if xrt and Vitis are installed in different paths, then run these commands
```shell
source <PATH_TO_XILINX_XRT>/setup.sh
source <PATH_TO_XILINX_VITIS_2022_1>/settings64.sh
scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
```

### Step 3 - Configure
**Optional**: this can be skipped if you do not want to change the default configuration.

Edit `default.cfg` to configure the accelerator. This step can be skipped, and the accelerator will be configured to support 512x512x512 volumes. Following, there are the configurable parameters:
```
DIMENSION := 512      # IMAGE SIZE
N_COUPLES_MAX := 512  # MAXIMUM VOLUME DEPTH 
HIST_PE := 16         # NUMBER OF PROCESSING ELEMENTS (BEST IS 16)
```
Note: every time this file is changed, you need to run `make config`. If any of the parameters in section "ARCHITECTURE PARAMETERS" you also must re-build the architecture.

The parameters of the transformation can be customized inside the host code, hence any modification requires to compile it again.

### Step 4 - Build
**Optional**: this project already contains a XCLBIN, you can jump the next step.

To build the project, run: 
```shell
make build_and_pack NAME=<build_name> TARTGET=<hw|hw_emu>
```
Note: the default value for `NAME` is "hw_build" and the default for `TARGET` is "hw".


### Step 5 - Run
The folder `build/<build_name>` contains the XCLBIN and all the other files reqiured for the execution. Move it on the host machine connected to board, enter the folder, and run the host application with:
```shell
./host_overlay.exe <volume_depth>
```
If not specified, the volume depth is set by default to 512, which is also the maximum supported depth with the bitstream provided.

The volume transformed in hardware is stored in the folder `dataset_output` as a sequence of png images, one for each slice. The folder `dataset_sw_output` contains the volume trasformed in software for comparison.


## Extra features
### Pack the build
After changing the dataset or re-building the host code, you should pack the build before running the framework. To do so, run
```shell
make pack NAME=<build_name>
```
This creates the folder `build/<builname>` containing the xclbin, the compiled host code and the dataset.

### Switch the dataset
If the folder `dataset` contains less images than the desired volume depth, set the variable `N_COUPLES` in file `default.cfg`, then, from the root of the project, run the following command to adapt the dataset to the specified volume:
```shell
make -C sw switch_dataset
```
Then, run
```shell
make pack NAME=<build_name>
```

### Build the host code
To build the host code, from the root of the project, run
```shell
make build_sw
```
Then, run
```shell
make pack NAME=<build_name>
```
